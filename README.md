# 🌸 Monthly Habit Tracker

This project was created by following a tutorial made by Cozy Olive Studios on Youtube.

The code was studied, adapted, and customized to become familiar with coding (as I am a beginner) and to start building new projects by following guidance from experienced developers.
The technologies used for this project are **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.**
